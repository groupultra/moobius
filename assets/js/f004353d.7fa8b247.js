Basically, a CCS is the mastermind behind a Channel, which controls every aspect of what a User sees in a Channel and what will happen when a User interacts with a Channel. Before we dive deeply into the specifics of how to write code to program a CCS, we may take a glimpse at how CCS works in general.","sidebar":"docs"},"tutorial-basics/GettingStarted":{"id":"tutorial-basics/GettingStarted","title":"GettingStarted","description":"To use Moobius, you have to register an account as a User. A user is always associated with a registered account.
