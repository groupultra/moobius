Technically, any Custom Channel Service has a unique Service ID on the Moobius Platform as an identifier. One User account can have multiple Service IDs under its name, and each Service ID could be associated with multiple Channels simultaneously. Each Service ID establishes a unique websocket connection to the Moobius platform. When a User Triggers an Upward Event in a Channel, the Moobius Platform will search for the Service ID associated with the Channel, and forward the Event to the Websocket connection.
