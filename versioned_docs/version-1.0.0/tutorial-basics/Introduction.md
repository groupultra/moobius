> Welcome to Moobius! This tutorial will explain in detail most of the basic concepts of Moobius and how Moobius works under the hood, and provide a step-by-step guide to development with Moobius from scratch with a simple but delicate example.

> Moobius is a free, fast and flexible platform for group-based applications (GBA). It can be interpreted in multiple ways:

:::note

Some parts of the tutorial are targeted for developers. These materials assume you have basic knowledge and experience of the Python programming language, including asynchronous programming (async/await). We use Python as an example because it is popular and easy-to-start, and we have a full-fledged SDK support in python. If you are familiar with any programming language other than Python, you may apply the concept similarly.

The "Tip" parts of this tutorial contain edge cases, catches, caveats and details. These materials are useful and may help you avoid a lot of mistakes if you are developing a GBA. However, first-time readers can choose to skip these parts for a quick understanding of the broader picture.

Correct terminology is critical to conveying ideas accurately. There are a lot of technical terms introduced in this tutorial, each has its specific meaning. When a term appears for the first time, it will be boldfaced, and it will almost always be capitalized in this tutorial (except when it appears in codes).
