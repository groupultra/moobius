Welcome to Moobius! This tutorial will explain in detail most of the basic concepts of Moobius and how Moobius works under the hood, and provide a step-by-step guide to development with Moobius Python SDK from scratch with a simple but delicate example.

Moobius is a free, fast and flexible platform for group-based applications (GBA) which allows per-user customization via the Python SDK. As the name suggests, it is not only suitable for building AI-native communities in the form of a group chat, but with enhanced features and customized, individualized user experience, but also great for developing quick demos of stable, real-world applications bearing a real-time communication feature with no Web/UI/frontend experience needed and minimal programming skill. Furthermore, we are an open-source platform that allows any third-party API integration and client customization, giving developers a lot of space to modify and explore.

We use Python in this tutorial, because it is popular and easy-to-start, and we have full-fledged SDK support in python. Nevertheless, you should still be able to understand this tutorial up to Section 3.3 and get an idea of the mechanism of Moobius (which is language-independent) and run our GBA demo (which you don't need to program yourself at all). If you are familiar with any programming language other than Python, you are encouraged to apply the basic idea of Moobius and develop the SDK in your favorite language for our open-source community.

The "Tip" parts of this tutorial contain edge cases, catches, caveats and details. These materials are useful and may help you avoid a lot of mistakes or know a lot of nuances if you are developing a GBA. However, first-time readers can choose to skip these parts for a quick understanding of the broader picture.
